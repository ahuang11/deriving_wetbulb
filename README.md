# deriving_wetbulb
There are many methods for calculating the wet bulb temperature like one-third rule and Stull's empirical formula, but the most accurate of them all is Normand's rule. The drawback to using Normand's rule is that it requires an iterative process to converge onto the solution and cannot be applied in a vectorized way which can lead to significant compute time if the array length is long. Here I explore deriving wet bulb temperatures using both a linear regression and a deep learning method, benchmarking against the other methods--treating Normand's rule as ground truth. I will be using NCEP Reanalysis to train and test my model and KMRY station timeseries for validation.
